# bamazon Version 1.0 02/01/2018

## Program Description

Bamazon is CLI store simulation consisting of three seperate node applications all connected together via two database tables.

* bamazonCusomer is the part of the application that the customer interacts with.  It loads showing every item availiable in the store and prompts the user to select what they would like to purchase, and at what quantity.  This activity lowers stock levels and updates the department revenue on the database.

* bamazonManager allows the user to check inventory levels on everything, add inventory at an amount chosen by the user, and add products.  It also has a function that shows the user any product that has a current inventory of less than 5. 

* bamazonSupervisor allows the user to add departments and view the profit/loss, revenue, and overhead values for each department.  The calculations for total profit are done in the sql query.
